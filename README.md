# Imposter: A scriptable, multipurpose mock server [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/outofcoffee/imposter/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/outofcoffee/imposter/tree/master)

Reliable, scriptable and extensible mock server for general REST APIs,
[OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (aka Swagger) specifications,
Salesforce and HBase APIs.

Scripting support for both JavaScript or [Groovy/Java](http://www.groovy-lang.org/).

## What's it for?

Use Imposter to:

* run standalone mocks in place of real systems
* turn a OpenAPI/Swagger file into a mock API for testing or QA
* quickly set up a temporary API for your mobile/web client teams whilst the real API is being built
* decouple your integration tests from the cloud/various back-end systems and take control of your dependencies

Provide mock responses using static files or customise behaviour using JavaScript or Java/Groovy. Power users can write their own plugins in a JVM language of their choice.

# Plugins

Imposter uses plugins to control its behaviour and provide specialised mocks:

* **[OpenAPI (aka Swagger)](docs/openapi_plugin.md)** - Support for [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (aka Swagger) API specifications.
* **[REST](docs/rest_plugin.md)** - Mocks RESTful or plain HTTP APIs.
* **[HBase](docs/hbase_plugin.md)** - Basic HBase mock implementation.
* **[SFDC (Salesforce) plugin](docs/sfdc_plugin.md)** - Basic Salesforce mock implementation.

You can also create your own plugins, using a JVM language of your choice.

# Example

Let's assume your [configuration](docs/configuration.md) is in a folder named `config`.

Docker example:

    docker run -ti -p 8080:8080 \
        -v $(pwd)/config:/opt/imposter/config \
        outofcoffee/imposter-rest

Standalone Java example:

    java -jar distro/rest/build/libs/imposter-rest.jar \
        --configDir ./config

Your mock server is now running!

This example starts a mock server using the simple [REST plugin](docs/rest_plugin.md), serving responses based on the configuration files inside the `config` folder. You can hit the URL [http://localhost:8080/example](http://localhost:8080/example) to see the mock response.
