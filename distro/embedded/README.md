Embedding Imposter in your JVM tests
====================================

This module enables you to embed the Imposter in your JVM tests, such as JUnit or TestNG.

This method uses pure JVM technologies (i.e. no Docker requirement).

See [the documentation](../../docs/embed_jvm.md) for usage and examples.
