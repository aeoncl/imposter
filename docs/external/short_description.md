# Short description (<1000 characters)

Imposter is a system that runs live, interactive mocks in place of real systems. Turn an OpenAPI file into a mock API for dev or QA. Run standalone mock servers, or embed mocks within your tests.

Validate HTTP requests to ensure they match the OpenAPI specification. Serve response examples embedded in the specification. Explore mock endpoints using the interactive API sandbox based on Swagger UI.

Imposter supports custom responses, headers, status codes etc. based on path, querystring, request headers, request body and more.Responses can be templated - that is, a file or string containing placeholders, which are replaced with values at runtime.

You can match resources to requests using attributes such as the HTTP method, path, query string, headers or body (both JSON and XML supported). Also supports script-driven responses for maximum control, in either JavaScript or Groovy.

Imposter also allows you to capture elements of the request, so you can retrieve them later.
