# Imposter: A scriptable, multipurpose mock server

Welcome to the Imposter documentation.

## Introduction

Imposter is a reliable, scriptable and extensible mock server for general REST APIs, [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (aka Swagger) specifications, Salesforce and HBase APIs.

## What's it for?

Use Imposter to:

* run standalone mocks in place of real systems
* turn a Swagger file into a mock API for testing or QA
* quickly set up a temporary API for your mobile/web client teams whilst the real API is being built
* decouple your integration tests from the cloud/various back-end systems and take control of your dependencies

Provide mock responses using static files or customise behaviour using JavaScript or Java/Groovy. Power users can write their own plugins in a JVM language of their choice.
